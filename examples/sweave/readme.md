# R Sweave (.Rnw) Example## Creating the .pdfcounts.Rnw is converted to a pdf file using the following command:```rrscript -e "library(knitr);knitr::knit2pdf('counts.Rnw')"```## CaveatBut the above does not run since counts.Rnw is a part of a largerproject that requires data and other files and assumes specificdirectory sturucture.# ThanksMany thanks to Prof. Salganik, who kindly gave a permission to showthe files as a demonstration of how R Sweave is used in an actualresearch project.
